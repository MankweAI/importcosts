### SADC‑EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) – Protocol 1

* **Document Title**: Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the SADC EPA States, of the other part (including Protocol 1 concerning the definition of the concept of “originating products” and methods of administrative cooperation)
* **Direct URL**: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:22016A0916(01)\&from=EN[^1]
* **Publisher/Authority**: European Union – Official Journal (EUR‑Lex)[^2][^1]
* **Publication Date**: 16 September 2016 (OJ L 250) – in force and still the base text as of 2025[^2]
* **Contains HS Rules Table?**: Yes. Protocol 1 includes **Annex II**, which is the “lists of the working or processing” each product must undergo (product‑specific rules of origin, PSRs). EU and SADC outreach material explicitly confirm that **Annex II to Protocol 1** contains the PSR tables, sorted by HS heading.[^3][^4]
* **Notes**:
    * This single OJ PDF contains the full EPA (Articles, Annexes, Protocols). Protocol 1 is embedded in the text; Annex II (PSR list) is a very long annex with HS‑based rules (“list of working or processing required to be carried out on non‑originating materials”).[^4][^3]
    * No separate, official EU PDF of “Protocol 1 only” could be located on europa.eu; extracted Protocol‑only PDFs tend to be hosted on third‑country agencies and are therefore not used here.
    * EU’s 2022 “Guide to the Protocol on rules of origin of the SADC‑EU EPA” is a helpful interpretive tool (not the legal text) and confirms Annex II as the definitive PSR list: https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-05/3883130_Guide-SADC-EU%20EPA_20220511.pdf[^4]


### SACUM‑UK Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) – Protocol 1 (Rules of Origin)

* **Document Title**: Economic Partnership Agreement between the Southern African Customs Union Member States and Mozambique, of the one part, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the other part (including Protocol 1 on the Rules of Origin)[^5][^6]
* **Direct URL**: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uksacu-and-mozambique-economic-partnership-agreement-ms-no342019[^6]
    * (The PDF of the treaty itself is linked in the **“Documents”** section of this gov.uk page; the URL is not exposed in scraped text, so the collection page is given.)
* **Publisher/Authority**: UK Government – Foreign, Commonwealth \& Development Office (Treaty Series)[^6]
* **Publication Date**:
    * Signed: 9 October 2019
    * Presented to UK Parliament: November 2019 (MS No. 34/2019)[^6]
    * Entry into force: 31 December 2020[^6]
* **Contains HS Rules Table?**: Yes. The SACUM‑UK EPA is a **“long‑form” rollover** of the SADC‑EU EPA and reproduces the trade‑related provisions, including Protocol 1 and its annexes, with only technical changes to make it operable in a UK–SACUM context. A Botswana/Business‑Botswana guide issued with official support states explicitly that **“the detailed provision of RoO under this agreement is further explained in the list rules in Annexes II and II(a) of Protocol 1 to the SACUM‑UK EPA”** (i.e. PSR tables by HS heading).[^7][^8]
* **Notes**:
    * The UK parliamentary report confirms that the SACUM‑UK EPA text is based directly on the SADC‑EU EPA, with relevant sections **“reproduced”** and adapted. That implies the product‑specific list rules remain substantively identical, save for EU→UK substitutions.[^8]
    * SARS guidance on SACUM‑UK implementation also treats it as a transition from the SADC‑EU EPA, reinforcing that Rules of Origin commitments (including PSRs) were transitioned rather than redesigned.[^9]
    * For machine parsing, you will need to download the treaty PDF from the gov.uk page above and extract **Protocol 1 plus Annexes II and II(a)** for the PSR tables.


### SADC Protocol on Trade – Annex I (Rules of Origin)

* **Document Title**: Annex I to the SADC Protocol on Trade – “Concerning the Rules of Origin for Products to be Traded Between the Member States of the Southern African Development Community”[^10]
* **Direct URL**: https://www.douanes.gov.mg/srcs/uploads/2020/12/douane_madagascar_sadc_rules_of_origin-1.pdf[^10]
* **Publisher/Authority**: Customs Administration of Madagascar (official SADC Member State customs authority, reproducing the SADC Annex I text)[^10]
* **Publication Date**: Original Annex I dates from the early 2000s; this version is the standard Annex I text as circulated by SADC and its members (metadata in some distributions indicates 2000–2008 updates).[^11][^10]
* **Contains HS Rules Table?**: Yes.
    * **Rule 2(2)(a)** of Annex I states that non‑wholly obtained products are “considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the **list in Appendix I of this Annex** are fulfilled”.[^10]
    * The same PDF contains **“APPENDIX I TO ANNEX I – Introductory Notes to the List of Conditions Regarding Working and Processing Carried Out on Non‑Originating Materials that Confers Originating Status”**, followed by the HS‑based list rules (PSRs).[^10]
* **Notes**:
    * No copy of Annex I with Appendix I could be located on sadc.int itself; in practice, the legally identical SADC Annex I text is hosted by several SADC customs administrations (e.g., Mauritius and Madagascar) and referenced by SARS in its tariff notices.[^12][^11]
    * SARS’s own SADC‑related tariff schedule describes Appendix I as **“list of conditions regarding working or processing required to be carried out on non‑originating materials in order that the products manufactured can obtain originating status”**, which matches this document’s Appendix I.[^12]
    * Annex I has been amended over time. For the most up‑to‑date consolidated SADC RoO, you may need to cross‑check against later SADC decisions and national tariff notices (e.g. SARS updates) when building your engine.


### AfCFTA – Annex 2 on Rules of Origin

* **Document Title**: Annex 2 – Rules of Origin (to the Protocol on Trade in Goods under the Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area) – Draft Compiled Annexes[^13]
* **Direct URL**: https://au.int/sites/default/files/documents/37121-doc-Compiled-Annexes_AfCFTA_Agreement_English.pdf[^13]
* **Publisher/Authority**: African Union (AU) – AfCFTA documents portal[^14][^13]
* **Publication Date**: Compiled annexes circulated around 2018–2019 during AfCFTA ratification; Annex 2 text has since been adopted, but the compiled PDF still labels some provisions “outstanding”.[^14][^13]
* **Contains HS Rules Table?**: **No, not in this PDF.**
    * Article 6(2) of Annex 2 explicitly says that **“Goods listed in Appendix IV shall qualify as originating Goods if they satisfy the specific rules set out therein”** – i.e., the PSR list is in **Appendix IV**.[^13]
    * In the compiled Annexes PDF, **Appendix IV is not yet inserted**. It is marked as an outstanding element (“Appendix IV … to be inserted”), and Article 42 lists **“Drafting hybrid rules in Appendix IV to Annex 2 on the Rules of Origin”** and completion of product‑specific rules as outstanding tasks.[^15][^13]
* **Notes**:
    * As of the latest authoritative analyses, **Appendix IV (AfCFTA product‑specific rules of origin) is still being completed** sector by sector; outstanding chapters include key sectors such as automotive and textiles.[^16][^15]
    * Practically, this means there is **no single, final, public AU PDF containing the complete PSR tables** yet. Product‑specific rules are being rolled out and discussed in technical working groups, and some national customs (e.g., Madagascar) and WCO/UNCTAD materials reference draft PSR thresholds, but these are not consolidated into an official AU “Appendix IV” PDF.[^17][^16][^15]
    * For implementation purposes, the AU’s **AfCFTA Rules of Origin Manual** is also important – it is formally intended to form an integral part of Annex 2 and includes guidance on “how to apply Appendix IV of Annex 2 on Rules of Origin”:
        * Manual PDF: https://au.int/sites/default/files/documents/42397-doc-AfCFTA_RULES_OF_ORIGIN_MANUAL.pdf[^18]
        * Landing page: https://au.int/en/documents/20221012/african-continental-free-trade-area-rules-origin-manual[^19]
    * Pending completion of Appendix IV, Article 42(3) of Annex 2 indicates that **existing trade regime rules of origin continue to apply**, which has implications for any AfCFTA‑wide preference engine.[^15][^13]

### ITAC Import Control Regulations – Consolidated Listing of Controlled Goods

* **Document Title**: International Trade Administration Act, 2002: Import Control – Government Notice No. R. 91, Government Gazette No. 35007 (including Schedules 1–4 listing goods subject to import control)[^20]
* **Direct URL**: https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/35007rg9676gon91.pdf[^20]
* **Publisher/Authority**: Government of South Africa – Government Gazette (Economic Development Department / ITAC)[^20]
* **Publication Date**: 10 February 2012[^20]
* **Contains HS Rules Table?**: **Yes, in the sense of HS‑based controlled‑goods tables.**
    * Schedules 1–4 list controlled goods by **tariff heading (HS code) and description**, specifying which lines require import permits. This is effectively a table of HS codes and control requirements, not origin rules.[^20]
* **Notes**:
    * This notice is the **base Import Control Regulations (R.91)** under the International Trade Administration Act and is repeatedly referenced in later Government Gazettes and ITAC guidelines as **“the regulations contained in Government Notice No. R. 91 published in Government Gazette No. 35007, dated 10 February 2012, as amended”**.[^21][^22][^23]
    * There are **multiple amendment notices** (e.g., 2013, 2015, 2016) that add or adjust tariff lines in the schedules – for example:
        * 2015 amendment: https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201512/39567rg10543gon1290.pdf[^24]
    * For a “current” consolidated list of controlled goods, you would need to apply R.91 plus all subsequent amendment notices. However, **R.91 is still the governing base text**, and there is no separate official “consolidated 2025 PDF” that merges all amendments.


### ITAC Import Control – Guidelines for Used / Second‑Hand Goods

#### 1) Used or Second‑Hand Vehicles and Related Components

* **Document Title**: Import Control Guidelines Pertaining to the Importation of Used or Second‑Hand Vehicles, Trucks, Buses, Taxis, Coaches, Motorcycles, Engines, Gearboxes, Differentials and Certain Vehicle Parts[^25]
* **Direct URL**: https://itac.org.za/wp-content/uploads/amended-guidelines-for-importation-of-used-or-second-hand-vehicles_.pdf[^25]
* **Publisher/Authority**: International Trade Administration Commission of South Africa (ITAC)[^26][^25]
* **Publication Date**: Not explicitly dated in the text; issued under the framework of the Import Control Regulations (R.91). Internal references and structure suggest a post‑2012 guideline (exact consolidation date unknown).
* **Contains HS Rules Table?**: No. The guideline describes categories of used vehicles/parts and the documentary/permit requirements; it does not contain HS‑by‑HS tables.
* **Notes**:
    * The guideline clarifies when import permits will/will not be issued for different categories of used vehicles (immigrants’ vehicles, returning residents, inherited vehicles, special‑purpose vehicles, commercial imports, engines/gearboxes/differentials, motorcycles, etc.) and how R.91 is applied.[^25]
    * It cross‑references application forms IE230/IE461/IE463 and other regulatory requirements (e.g. NRCS, SAPS Second‑Hand Goods Act certificates).[^25]
    * For your engine, this is important to **layer on top of tariff‑based control rules** from R.91 when dealing with used automotive goods.


#### 2) Used / Second‑Hand Donated Goods

* **Document Title**: Import Control Guidelines Pertaining to the Importation of Donated Used or Second‑Hand Goods (amended guidelines – working document)[^27]
* **Direct URL**: https://itac.org.za/wp-content/uploads/amended-guidelines-for-importation-of-donated-goods_-2.docx[^27]
* **Publisher/Authority**: International Trade Administration Commission of South Africa (ITAC)[^27]
* **Publication Date**: Not clearly stated in the snippet; appears as an amended guideline circulated via ITAC (post‑2012, referencing R.91).
* **Contains HS Rules Table?**: No. It sets conditions and processes for import permits for donated used goods, not HS‑specific lists.
* **Notes**:
    * The guideline states that **“The importation of all goods listed in the Import Control Regulations including used or second‑hand goods, used and second‑hand donated goods included, is subject to import control measures…”** and outlines additional requirements for donated goods (documentation from donors, etc.).[^28][^27]
    * Although the file is in DOCX format rather than PDF, it is an official ITAC document and should be considered part of your “used goods” rules layer.


#### 3) General ITAC Import/Export Control Pamphlet (Context)

* **Document Title**: Import and Export Control – ITAC Pamphlet[^26]
* **Direct URL**: https://itac.org.za/wp-content/uploads/ImportExportControl.pdf[^26]
* **Publisher/Authority**: ITAC[^26]
* **Publication Date**: Pamphlet, undated; describes the regime as at approximately mid‑2010s.
* **Contains HS Rules Table?**: No.
* **Notes**:
    * Provides a high‑level overview of import/export control, including the general rule that **“for the importation of all used or second-hand goods, an import permit is required”** and that a list of controlled goods is available from ITAC.[^26]
    * Useful background for modelling permit logic, but not the primary legal list.

***

### SARS – Prohibited \& Restricted Imports and Exports (Consolidated List)

* **Document Title**: Consolidated List of Prohibited and Restricted Imports and Exports (referenced list under SARS “Prohibited, Restricted and Counterfeit Goods”)
* **Direct URL**:
    * **Landing/Information Page**: https://www.sars.gov.za/customs-and-excise/prohibited-restricted-and-counterfeit-goods/[^29]
    * **Afrikaans info‑sheet (explaining and linking to the list)**: https://www.sars.gov.za/wp-content/uploads/Docs/Translations/Customs/Afr20180444T-Website_Prohibited-restricted-and-counterfeit-goods.pdf[^30]
* **Publisher/Authority**: South African Revenue Service (SARS) – Customs \& Excise[^31][^29]
* **Publication Date**:
    * The consolidated list itself is **continuously updated**; SARS “What’s New?” entries show updates as recent as **December 2025** (e.g. “4 December 2025 – Updated Prohibited and Restricted Imports and Exports list”).[^32][^29]
    * The Afrikaans info‑sheet is an explanatory document that references the consolidated list.
* **Contains HS Rules Table?**: Yes, conceptually.
    * Both the English and Afrikaans explanatory texts state that prohibitions and restrictions from all departments are **“incorporated in the Consolidated List of Prohibited and Restricted Imports and Exports”**, and that **“the list is categorised according to the tariff structure of the Harmonised Commodity Coding and Description System (HS Tariff or Tariff Book)”**.[^29][^30]
    * SARS operational policies confirm that goods subject to prohibitions/restrictions are listed in this consolidated HS‑based list and that officers must “refer to this list when necessary”.[^31]
* **Notes**:
    * The **direct static URL of the consolidated list file (PDF/Excel)** is **not surfaced in the scraped content**; SARS exposes it via a hyperlink labelled “Consolidated list of Prohibited and Restricted Exports and Imports” on the info page and in the Afrikaans PDF.[^30]
    * For your scraper, the most robust approach is:
        * Start from the English info page above;
        * Programmatically follow the hyperlink labelled “Consolidated list of Prohibited and Restricted Exports and Imports” to the underlying file (often an XLSX or PDF);
        * Note that SARS frequently replaces the list file when updated, rather than versioning by year, so you should expect a **stable URL with changing content** rather than per‑year PDFs.
    * The list is **not a rules‑of‑origin table**, but an HS‑based mapping of tariff lines to prohibition/restriction and the responsible authority – critical for integrating prohibitions and permit‑requirements with your preference engine.

***

### AfCFTA Agreement – Context for Annex 2

* **Document Title**: Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area – Consolidated Text[^14]
* **Direct URL**: https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/36437-treaty-consolidated_text_on_cfta_-_en.pdf[^14]
* **Publisher/Authority**: African Union (AU)[^14]
* **Publication Date**: 2018 consolidated agreement text[^14]
* **Contains HS Rules Table?**: No. It references Annexes (including Annex 2 on Rules of Origin) but does not include the product‑specific rules.
* **Notes**:
    * For a complete legal picture, this agreement PDF plus the **Annex 2 PDF** above form the core AfCFTA RoO legal basis. The actual **product‑specific rules (Appendix IV)** remain under negotiation and are not yet integrated as a final AU‑published PSR list.[^15][^13]

***

### Validation Summary – Presence of HS Product‑Specific Rules (“List of working or processing…”)

For quick reference against your validation question:


| Instrument | Contains HS product‑specific rules table in the cited document? | Where / Status |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **SADC‑EU EPA – Protocol 1** | **Yes** | Annex II to Protocol 1 (within OJ CELEX:22016A0916(01)); confirmed by EU/SADC guides.[^3][^4] |
| **SACUM‑UK EPA – Protocol 1** | **Yes** | Protocol 1 replicated from SADC‑EU EPA; Business‑Botswana guide refers to list rules in Annexes II and II(a) to Protocol 1.[^7][^8] |
| **SADC Protocol on Trade – Annex I** | **Yes** | Appendix I to Annex I contains the PSR list; Annex I PDF from Madagascar Customs includes Appendix I and its introductory notes.[^10][^12] |
| **AfCFTA – Annex 2** | **Not in current compiled Annex 2 PDF** | Annex 2 refers to Appendix IV for PSRs, but in the compiled annexes PDF Appendix IV is still marked “to be inserted”; completion of Appendix IV is formally listed as an outstanding task.[^13][^15] |
| **ITAC Import Control Regulations (R.91)** | **Yes, but for control/permits, not origin** | Schedules 1–4 list controlled goods by HS code; effectively HS tables for import‑permit requirements, not RoO.[^20] |
| **ITAC Used‑Goods Guidelines** | **No** | Narrative permit criteria for used vehicles/parts and donated goods; no HS‑headings table.[^25][^27] |
| **SARS Consolidated List of Prohibited \& Restricted Imports/Exports** | **Yes** | Maintained as an HS‑structured list (PDF/XLS) reachable via the SARS “Prohibited, restricted and counterfeit goods” page; direct file URL not visible in scraped content, but the list is described as HS‑categorised.[^29][^30] |

If you want, the next step can be to design a scraping/parsing strategy per document (e.g., how to isolate Annex II of Protocol 1, how to normalise HS headings from Appendix I of SADC Annex I, or how to deal with AfCFTA’s incomplete Appendix IV) and map them into a unified rules‑of‑origin schema for your preference engine.
